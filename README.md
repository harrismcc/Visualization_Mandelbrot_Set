# Julia Sets

## Overview:
Julia sets are fractals of imaginary numbers iterated n number of times according to the following equation: ![eq](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f_{c}(z)=z^{2}&plus;c). By plotting the real and imaginary parts of these numbers the sets can be visualized. By changing the starting value of the imaginary number different Julia sets can be represented.

## Files and Usage:

__cs5png3.py__	        
	A Library to draw pixels on a png and save the image (Written by and property of Harvey Mudd College)

__jset.py__	         
	Run this file to create the Julia set. By changing the "a" constant the Julia set can be changed. Use the XMIN/MAX and YMIN/MAX to zoom in or out, and FRAMES to detirmine the number of frames if creating an animation.
